# Greenhouse

You are a toxic plant that keeps expanding and expanding to keep from snuffing
itself out.

## Game mechanic

You keep having to break out of a series of ever-larger enclosures:
- pot
  - Play Fun1.ogg until roots grow, then Fun2.ogg
  - Burst pot and fall into enclosure in greenhouse
- room dividers
  - Play Fun3.ogg until absorbs vine, then Fun4.ogg
  - Climb vine to get out of enclosure, see whole greenhouse
- greenhouse
  - Gardener inside greenhouse watering watermelons
  - Play Mid1.ogg until consumes watermelons, then Mid2.ogg
  - Launches watermelons, greenhouse collapses around gardener
- village moat
  - Collection of buildings, tree near a stream/moat, grow vine on tree so it falls across moat
  - Play Mid3.ogg until attaching to tree, then Mid4.ogg
  - Grow tree, cut it down to get across moat
- island
  - Play Dark1.ogg until starting to eat seaweed, then Dark2.ogg
  - Show destroyed buildings, paths, civilization etc.
  - Consume algae/seaweed to grow into ocean
- whole planet animation (not level)
  - Play ShortEnd.ogg or LongEnd.ogg depending on animation
  - Plant spreads across planet and then dies
  - Clip 1: Plant crawls across planet
  - Clip 2: Shot of blood dripping from plant and planet
    - While dripping, plant thrashes around, cracks planet
  - Clip 3: Plant withers
  - Fade to black

The way you control your plant colony is by stimulating or preventing growth in
different places. As you find and assimilate other species of plants, you can
start using their powers, which also gives more choice to the player.

## Philosophical impetus

The will to life is such that it destroys other forms of life in order to
persist

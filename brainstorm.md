# Greenhouse

You are a toxic plant that keeps expanding and expanding to keep from snuffing
itself out.

## Game mechanic

You keep having to break out of a series of ever-larger enclosures:
- pot
- coldframe
- greenhouse
- stone wall
- village moat
- island
- different climates
- planets!
- GALAXIES oH mY gOsH

The way you control your plant colony is by stimulating or preventing growth in
different places. As you find and assimilate other species of plants, you can
start using their powers, which also gives more choice to the player.

## Philosophical impetus

The will to life is such that it destroys other forms of life in order to
persist

Art Needed
==========

Scene 1
-------

- blood spritesheet
  - (if this results in layering issues then I also need a new pot exterior
    spritesheet)
- plant withering spritesheet

Scene 2
-------

- more frames in the plant spritesheet:
  - reaching out to the left or right to grab the bean plants
- blood spreading
  - the blood needs to be able to reach the bean plants and the vines that the
    player grows
- spritesheets for each of the bean plants that the player can grow
  - these can possibly be reused; just give me the coordinates that I should
    place them in the scene
- make the vines farther away
  - specifically, the one reachable from growing bean plants should be in the
    12x12 square with top-left corner (82, 40)
  - then we need frames in the vine spritesheet for the other vines shrinking up
    to the top of the wall and disappearing
  - also I'm not sure anymore if we need to keep the "shove vine into the
    ground" thing but if so then we need animation for that; in any case we need
    animation for reaching out to grab the vine
- one or two spritesheets for the vines the player can grow
